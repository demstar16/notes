# Storytelling

- Utilise the fact that games can take many different branches and taking advantage of this makes a good game.

## Protagonist

- The main character... HIM
- They have wants, needs, motives and change throughout the story.
- You normally play as them.
- The more story focused a game is, the more defined the protagonist will be.
- Games with no story focus doesn't really have a protagonist... just the player.
- An enticing protagonist should want something, have some purpose, goals, motives.
- Protagonists with goals and conflicts are normally voiced, however it should be a conscious decision whether or not you want your hero to speak or not.
- Games with less of a story focus tend to go for a silent protagonist (skyrim, portal, etc.)
- Sometimes you play a character who isn't the antagonist but isn't really a hero... we call this the **Anti-Hero**.
  - You need to ensure that your Anti-Hero is likeable, which can be harder than making a hero.
  - This is because they do bad things but you need to set the context so that we understand that they're doing it for a good reason.

## Antagonist

- The villain of the story.
- Establish the story's conflict and are the protagonist's driving force.
- Aim of the story is usually to defeat the antagonist.
- They usually give the protagonist their reasons, they set the story.

## Three Act Structure

- **Act 1: Setup**
  - Sets up the world, characters, protagonist, and antagonist.
  - This act ends when the inciting incident occurs.
  - This is where the situation changes and the player's goals for the rest of the game are established.
- **Act 2: Confrontation**
  - AKA rising action.
  - This is where we find the protagonist trying to solve the conflict only to find themselves in a worsening situation.
  - A plot point at the end of this act will start the 3rd act (could be a goal change for example.)
- **Act 3: Resolution**
  - This is where the story and subplots are resolved.
  - Questions are answered.
  - It leaves the protagonist and other characters with a new sense of who they really are.

## Storytelling methods

### Cutscenes

- Pre-made scenes that help further the story.
- Characters talking, action happening, transitioning between levels, etc.
- They allow for pre-defined cinematic content that developers want the player to see.
- 2 types:
  - In-game
    - Game is temporarily disrupted.
    - Player loses and control.
  - Cinematic
    - Used for more direct storytelling purposes.
    - Composition, multiple cuts, it's more like a movie.
    - Sometimes they've been pre-rendered, meaning its just a video that's playing.

### Dialogue

- Generally a choice.
- Can allow multiple outcomes by choosing what they say.

### Environmental Storytelling

- Use the game world to give context to the setting and story.

### Game World Items

- Things like books and audio logs which can explain elements of the story or history of the world.
- Useful for games with in-depth lore that cannot be explained throughout the story.

### Narration

- Good method to explain the story to the player or guide them through the game.
- The narrator can be an ambiguous voice, or a character in the game.
- Portal is a good example where the antagonist is the narrator.

## Choices

- Choice is what makes games stand out from movies and books.
- **Pros**: allows the player to feel like their actions matter, provides replayability, allows for a more immersive story,
- **Cons**: can be harder to design, lack of varied endings can make choices seem useless, may not be the type of experience you're going for.
- **Types of stories**: Linear, multiple endings, branching story.

### Non-story choices

- Not all choices need to affect the story.
- RPGs are popular because of the customisations.

### Morality systems

- Is a nice way of shaping how your character behaves.
  - Speaking in cutscenes for example.
- It can change and shape the world around you, are you a good person or a bad person?

## Quests

- Tasks that the player needs to complete to progress through the game.
- They can either be given out automatically or the player must seek them out.
- Types:
  - **Main**: Linear progression that guides you through the story.
  - **Side**: Complement the main quest line, enhance world building and provide small stories to tell.

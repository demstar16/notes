# Soft Skills & Testing

_Notes from a FrontendMasters course: [Software Developer Success: Soft Skills & Testing](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/dev-soft-skills/introduction/)_

## Ramping Up in a New Team

- **Ask questions**! Don't feel embarrassed, especially at the start.
- Pair program with others or shadow another engineer that's been there for a while.
  - Good to observe and see how the team or company usually works.
  - Which parts are good and bad in the codebase.
  - Patterns to follow.
  - Testing state.
  - PR processes and feedback norms.
  - This doesn't mean to just follow it, but it's good to see how things are currently being done.

## Time Estimation

- Tasks are generally flexible.
- Common obstacles when executing tasks:
  - Under-communicating
  - Not understanding how long a task will take.
  - Not having enough information about the task.
- Some things you can do to avoid going over deadlines are:
  - Seek help.
  - Notify when blocked as soon as possible.
- **Spike the Task**:
  - Spike is an agile term.
  - Go into each requirement at once upfront.
  - This gives you the chance to see how much time and effort is going to be needed.
  - Helps give you an understanding of what's to come and if you need more help.
  - Testing and requirements are all being implemented in amongst each other.
- Practice Breaking Down Tasks.
- Understand the lifecycle of bringing a feature to life so that you know how long it will take.
- **Over Communicate**:
  - What:
    - What is done.
    - What is in-progress.
    - What are blockers.
    - What is at risk of not being delivered.
  - Who:
    - Manager.
    - Teammates working on the task.
    - Stakeholders relying on the work.
- **Gather info**:
  - What is the task
  - Validation steps
  - Who are the stakeholders
  - Who is relying on it
  - Why the task matters
  - When is it needed

## Feedback Loops

- Weekly or bi-weekly feedback sessions.
- You want timely feedback.
- Ask specific questions:
  - What areas can I improve upon?
  - How did I go on that journey?
  - What goals or objectives should I focus on for the next couple of months?
  - How do you gain visibility into my work?

## Asking for Help

- Trying not to trigger your imposter syndrome.
- Timeboxing.
- Treat each Q&A session as an opportunity to build trust:
  - Show your due diligence.
  - Collaborate on a final solution.
  - Clarify assumptions.
  - Express gratitude.

## Surface your Accomplishments

- Managers are busy, sometimes work can go unnoticed and unnoticed work could be mistaken for inactivity.
- Sometimes its important to visualise your achievements, impact and work.
- Advocate for yourself.|
- Rewards & Promotions are subjective and given out by people based on results and trust.
- How to surface your accomplishments:
  - Create & Regularly update a brag doc.
  - Create regular communication loops with manager.
  - Understand the promotion and rewards process.

## Opportunities

- It is important (for fast career growth) to foster your own opportunities.
- How to get more opportunities to come your way:
  - Build relationships of trust with those around you.
  - Create your own, ask for more work.
- Relationships drive opportunities.
- Collaboration and respect are important, in order to get put on the big projects, you need to work well in a team.

## Active Listening

- You must attune with the speakers feelings and thoughts.
- **Cognitive**: Paying attention to all the information, both explicit and implicit, that you are receiving from the other person, comprehending, and integrating that info.
- **Emotional**: Staying calm and compassionate during the conversation, including managing any emotional reactions (annoyance, boredom) you might experience.
- **Behavioural**: Conveying interest and comprehension verbally and non-verbally.
- Listen with intent, make the other person feel heard and understood.
  - If you hear something interesting, ask for more info about it.
  - If you hear something you don't understand, ask what it means.
- Have a genuine desire to get to know someone.

### Tactics

**Mirroring**: Restate what they said in your own terms to see if you understood.

Example:

- I'm worried about my presentation for the board meeting.
- _Oh what about the presentation is worrying you?_
- I'm worried about...

**Label emotions**: label the emotions that you notice to see if you understood how they felt, and help you empathise.

Example:

- They just wouldn't listen, even though I brought it up so many times!
- _Did that feel really frustrating?_
- Exactly! It was frustrating because...

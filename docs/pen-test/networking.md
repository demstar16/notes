## IP Addresses

- View your IPs with `ifconfig`.
- **Ipv4 address** is the most common IP format (eg. `192.168.57.139`).
  - It is just 32 bits represented in something a bit more human readable.
  - There are roughly 4 billion IP addresses (we have a lot more people in the world then that, and they are all gone.)
- **IPv6** is 128 bits which gives us heaps more IP addresses to use.
- Everyone still mainly uses IPv4 even though all the addresses are gone... we do this through **Network Address Translation** (NAT).

### NAT

- Private IP address spaces.
  - These aren't counted out in the public world.
  - Reserved for private LANs.
  - `192.168` is private. We have ranges 0-255 for the other 2 places.

## Overview

My first fully functional (still in dev at the moment) app being built as a tool for my family's cleaning business where the user can input values and then be recommended which machine best fits their situation. I'm learning a great deal about many technologies as I work through it. I'd like to note that it is not engineered exactly how I'd like due to time constraints. I'm developing purely for pace and once I have a MVP ready before the deadline, I plan to re-iterate the existing app and deepen my understanding along with make the app better through creating elaborate test suites. I then plan to follow a Test Driven Approach for further additions to the app.

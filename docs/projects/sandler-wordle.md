# Adam Sandler Wordle

## What Is It?

This is one of my personal favourites! Although very poorly built (I must admit), I just loved the idea and it was one of my first projects I made that was a game that people could play. It is a unique wordle clone where each day you play an audio clip from an Adam Sandler movie and guess what movie it is from.

# Part 1 - Welcome

- We are implementing a language by the name of **Lox**.
- Successful languages usually come about due to a combination of many small niche languages, **domain specific languages**.
- Some example of little languages include:
  - yarn 
  - Make
  - YAML 
  - SQL 
  - AWK 

## Book Structure

- Part II & Part III each walk you through building a Lox interpreter.
- Each chapter is structured the same: 
  - Takes a single language feature.
  - Teaches the concepts.
  - Walks you through an implementation.
- **NOTE: The challenges at the end of chapters are exploratory and there for enhanced understanding. If tackling these, make a copy of the project and explore there. The chapters that continue to build assume you have not done any of the challenges.**

## The Build

- The first interpreter will be built in **java** with a focus on concepts.
